This repository contains beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate basic programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and the use of built-in modules. The tasks include checking if a number is even or odd, summing integers within a range, calculating factorials, and performing mathematical operations using Pythonâ€™s math module.

Task1: Factorial Function
Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument.
Calculates its factorial using a loop.
Returns the calculated factorial.
Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
Asks the user for a number as input.
Uses the math module to calculate:
Square root of the number
Natural logarithm (base e) of the number
Sine of the number (in radians)
Displays the calculated results.
